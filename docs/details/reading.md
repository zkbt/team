📚 Please spend some time reading this paper. Be comfortable, have fun, don’t stress too much if it’s confusing, celebrate when you finish. 🎉

📜 Paper:
(What is the ADS link to the paper?)

🤔 Motivation:
(Why should we read this paper?)

🧑‍🏫 General Questions:
1. Briefly describe the key ideas/methods/conclusions/results the *authors* want us to take away from this paper. 
2. Briefly describe the key ideas/methods/consclusions/results that *we* take away from this paper as being useful to our research goals. (This *might* be identical to the authors’ main points, but often it might be the case that for our own goals we’re deeply interested in one specific method or plot or equation or problem in the paper.)
3. Insert a favorite plot or equation from the paper. Briefly describe what it shows and why we should be interested in it. 
4. Highlight a part of the paper that doesn’t make sense to you (yet). This might be a tiny thing like a vocabulary word, it might a confusing plot, or it might be an entire result. Ask what questions you have about it. (You do *not* need to take the next step and then try to answer those questions. You can if you want to, but it’s 
5. Identify one other paper/chapter/code/resource you want to read next after this one. This might be an older work cited in the paper, it might be a more recent work that cites the paper, it might be something else you find relevant to questions this paper inspired. 

🧑‍💻 Specific Questions:
1. (What specific domain-specific questions should we try to answer?) 

🧠 Metacognition:
Early on, it’s good to practice reading papers all the way through. Writing papers is a key part of our job, and reading papers all the way through is a necessary way to figure out what makes a good paper. Be aware of what you know and you don’t yet know, highlighting words or phrases or ideas that you don’t yet understand. Pay attention to how a paper is structured, how clearly it explains what’s happening, how plots and equations are explained, what narrative it’s telling, what pops for you. Later on or in specific situations, we might start skimming to extract just key ideas we need, but don’t rush into that habit; kind people like you put a lot of effort into writing a beautiful paper for you to read.
