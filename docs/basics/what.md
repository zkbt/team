# What are we doing? 

## Learning and Exploring 
We learn how to do science by doing science. By practicing science in an academic setting, our work sits fundamentally at the intersection of learning and discovering. Sometimes, it may feel like we're repeating what other folks have already done, learning methods by practicing them in safe settings with known answers. Other times, it may feel like we're entirely out in space on our own, doing something entirely new at the edge of discovery; at these times, we are learning on a grander scale, as part of the scientific community working together to advance our collective understanding of the sky surrounding us.

## Discovering and Sharing
It is a joyful and magical thing to read a paper that starts from the literature of what has come before, adds a few clever ideas/observations/calculations, and teaches us something fundamentally new about the Universe. It is powerful and important and beautiful to write papers that might teach someone else something new and true. The papers we write are permanent and public records of our learning and teaching, precious pearls of knowledge grown around the grit of curiosity, and deep kindnesses to our fellow scientists also eager to figure out how everything works. Giving talks and sharing code and chatting at conferences are most powerful when they connect to papers that appear in the peer-reviewed literature, where folks a month, a year, a decade, a century from now can turn to find clear answers about what we have done. 

## Mentoring and Growing
Zach's core mentoring goal is to help cultivate an ecosystem where your curiousity, brightness, hard work can grow into a productive and satisfying scientific career. In the long term, that might take the form of working as a professional astronomer or planetary scientist, nurturing others' passion for scientific thinking as a teacher or informal educator, caring for planet Earth, designing infrastructure, advancing technology to enable new discoveries, serving communities with compassion and equity, and/or anything that uses your strengths to provide for yourself, your family, and those who count on you. In the near term, our effort will mostly be focused on building your astronomer toolkit, writing papers, expanding your network, exploring creative opportunities, and caring for your well-being. Establishing a productive mentoring relationship takes time and effort; Zach promises to do his best (which sometimes won't feel like enough!) and asks that you please do the same. 

## Being Kind
We study stars that are lightyears away. What we do is very big and beautiful, but it is not fundamentally so important that it should come at cost of people's health, well-being, safety, ability to raise a family, right to ancestral lands, or sense of self-worth. At times, astronomy will be hard, everyone might not be able to get get everything we immediately want, and parts of this job will feel frustratingly beyond out control. In difficult situations, we should choose to bring kindness, compassion, patience, and understanding to the process of advocating for ourselves and others.


## Topics Covered

What are the core concepts that astronomers who observe exoplanets and stars should know? What ideas should we work to demonstrate carefully, to demystify the process of astronomy and enable scholars to create new knowledge? What skills should we be proud to have learned as students? 

In the 5-7 years of a PhD, a student might hopefully explore almost all of these concepts. In a 0.25-2 year undergraduate research experience, a student might focus on a few of these areas. The list below is aspirational guide, not a rigid requirement or a promise. It is not not inspired by wondering what Samin Nosrat's [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) might look like in our research group.
