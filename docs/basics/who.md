# Who are we? 

## **Humans practicing astronomy together!** 

- As **humans**, we have lives and interests and passions and emotions. Some parts of those may naturally shine forth continually, and they might be helpful or fun to share in the professional scientific spaces we occupy during our work days/nights. Some parts of those may be deeply personal and private, and we might not want to share or discuss them with our work/school colleagues. Sometimes, the boundaries between these categories might blur and morph. We should all feel supported in bringing however much of our whole selves we want to science, but we should never feel that science is demanding more of us than we want to give. 
- By **practicing**, we acknowledge that we are all students, all learning, all trying new and hard things, all not perfect, and all working to improve. No one magically knows how to do everything at once; so much of science is showing up and reading and trying things and learning new concepts, iteratively building on our existing skills and strengths. Being brilliant takes training and practice. As the [sculptor Ruth Asawa once said](https://www.janm.org/press/release/sculpture-ruth-asawa-contours-air-displays-prolific-career-wire-sculpture-artist) "Sculpture is like farming. If you just keep at it, you can get quite a lot done." 
- In **astronomy**, we rarely visit the places we study. Our understanding of distant exoplanetary systems fundamentally grows out of interpreting observations. Poking at the puzzles of the Cosmos requires physics and statistics and curiosity and patience and carefully-stated assumptions and humility. It is rarely the case that we are able to gather all the pieces of a astronomical puzzle at once, so we have to be comfortable with imperfect knowledge and always practice carefully stating what we do and don't know. 
- Working **together**, we can get a lot done! Collaboration is important both for bringing folks with complementary skills together and for having a friendly and understanding community to work in. Academia, requiring deep focus on a narrow scientific investigations, can sometimes feel lonely. Whether we are directly working specific projects together or helping learn from each others' knowledge or proudly cheering each other on from outside, let's do what we can to build an equitable and inclusive environment where we support and uplift and celebrate and care for each other. 


## How to join? 

- **Undergraduate Students** may sometimes join our group, as paid observers or scientific coders, as paid creative [Colorado Scholars of Astropysics and Art](https://craftingthecosmos.github.io/csa2.html), with grants from the CU [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://www.colorado.edu/urop/), as participants in [STEM Routes Uplift](https://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/stemroutes/uplift-research-program) or [Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training](https://www.colorado.edu/initiative/cdi/undergraduate-stem-research/smart-program-information), for [independent study credit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13jQoEFdk8RsGCHJrOYLmM0oh-Mu_u4SqYJ9ZIx3QoMY/edit), or to write an [Honors Thesis](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/undergraduate-students/honors-program). *We are not currently accepting new undergraduate students for either Summer or Fall 2024; if positions become available, we will post them on [APS Research Opportunities](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/undergraduate-students/ready-research) and advertise them through the APS departmental email list.*
- **Graduate Students** interested in working in our group must first be admitted to the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences [PhD Graduate Program](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/prospective-students). A typical path to join the group might often look like flexibly attending group meetings during your first academic year at CU, and then starting in a paid resarch position during the summer after your first year. Graduate students are strongly encouraged to apply for independent funding through opportunities like the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) or NASA [Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7b2CA37D02-F6A7-9746-68C1-8B681D7532EA%7d&path=open); winning these fellowships enables more flexibility in the projects you can pursue! *If you are an admitted or current CU graduate student interested in working with us on observational and statistical projects related to planets and stars, please come talk to Zach.*
- **Postdoctoral Researchers** are extremely welcome to join our group, although sadly we do not have funding for additional postdocs. If you are interested in working with us at CU, we hope you will please consider applying for a national independent postdoctoral fellowship like the [51 Peg b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/programs/science/51-pegasi-b-fellowship/), the [NSF/AAPF](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nsf-astronomy-astrophysics-postdoctoral), and/or the [NASA/Hubble](https://nexsci.caltech.edu/sagan/fellowship.shtml) and use the funding to come collaborate in our research community at CU. *If you have questions about applying to these or other fellowships with CU as your host institution, please contact Zach and/or other potential advisors here in Boulder.*

## Code of Conduct 

We strive to approach our research and learning relationships with kindness, generosity, patience, and mutual respect for those around us. We dedicate ourselves to providing an equitable, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone participating in our research team. We will not tolerate harassment, abusive behavior, intimidation, or bullying in any form, and particularly as they align along axes of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, religion, or disability. We agree to avoid these behaviors and to abide by the statements in the [AAS Code of Ethics](https://aas.org/policies/ethics). 

If you experience/observe a violation of this Code of Conduct, behavior that you otherwise find potentially troublesome, or a situation you simply feel you need to discuss, please talk to someone. If you are comfortable doing so, please come talk to Zach. If you don't feel comfortable talking with Zach (for example, if he's the source of the problem), please consider discussing your issue with a trusted [faculty member](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/people/faculty), with departmental or Fiske/SBO [staff](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/people/faculty), with the [Ombuds Office](https://www.colorado.edu/ombuds/), and/or the [Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC)](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/). We will work to address any issues you bring up in direct consultation with you and potentially with campus experts. We will follow your wishes for privacy and confidentiality, although for some issues we may be required to notify OIEC.
