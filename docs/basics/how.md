# How do we explore the Universe? 

- coding (conda environments, github, WSL/OSX, cluster, astropy + friends = don't reinvent)
- reading (ADS, papers, books)
- writing (LaTeX, overleaf, style)
- visualizing (visualization tips, poster advice, draw your plots, intentional graphics, animations)
- proposing (proposal advice, planning)
- collaborating (communication, fairness, openness)
