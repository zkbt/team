# Research Team Documentation

This site attempts to serve as a how-to guide for practicing science in [Zach Berta-Thompson](https://casa.colorado.edu/~bertathompson/)'s planets and stars research group. Just as the science and code we produce should be clear and explicit and friendly, these team documentation pages aim to write down things we should know, so nobody has to guess. 

Herein you will find information about how to join the group, what mutual expectations we should hold for each other, logistical day-to-day details, tips and tricks for more efficient research, big dreamy ideas about joy and play in science, and more. 

The name "BT and the Planeteers" is purposefully silly to try to encourage us to please not take ourselves too seriously. Zach is not actually trying to be [Captain Planet](https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2024/06/captain-planet-and-the-planeteers-controversial-legacy); if anything, at his best, he strives to be [Heart](https://captainplanet.fandom.com/wiki/Ma-Ti). 🪨💨💧🔥❤️

We each bring myriad individual strengths into the process of learning and discovering as astronomers. These shared guidelines are not meant to squash or homogenize our scientific personalities; the goal is to try to define a landscape where each group members feels supported and comfortable in shining in their own unique way. 

Especially in light of that goal, everything written here is extremely open to revision. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, objects, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/zkbt/team/issues) and/or talk to Zach!
